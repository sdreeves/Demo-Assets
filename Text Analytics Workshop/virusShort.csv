However, the virus was first isolated between 1952-1953 from both man and mosquitoes during an epidemic of fever that was considered clinically indistinguishable from dengue, in the Tanzania."
56,"Chikungunya fever displays interesting epidemiological profiles: major epidemics appear and disappear cyclically, usually with an inter-epidemic period of 7-8 years and sometimes as long as 20 years. After a long period of absence, outbreaks of CHIK fevers have appeared in Indonesia in 1999."

65,"INTRODUCTION: The debilitating mosquito-borne viral disease Chikungunya has been mapped as a major public and international health concern following minor epidemic outbreaks from January to April 2005 and severe epidemics from January to April 2006. Chikungunya spread in Reunion, Mauritius, Comoros and Mayotte.1 India was also severely affected. A number of imported cases of chickungunya have been registered in Europe and North America. The epidemics seem to have originated in the Kenyan coastal towns of Lamu (June 2004) and Mombasa (November 2004) where unsafe water storage and elevated temperatures during an unusually dry climatic period may have facilitated the development of mosquitoes and transmission of the Chikungunya virus. Chikungunya then spread to the Comoros, Reunion, and Mayotte before reaching Mauritius in April 2005. In Reunion and Mauritius, the pace of the viral spread slowed during the cooler months of June to October, picking up explosively in January 2006 in Reunion and in early February 2006 in Mauritius. The epidemic peaked in March 2006 in these two islands, with most cases appearing in the months of February and March, and died out towards the end of April 2006 in Mauritius. The disease had in the meantime re-emerged in India after an absence of 23 years before affecting the Maldives. More than a million people have been affected by Chikungunya since January 2005. There have been recent outbreaks of chikungunya in Gabon and Italy. However, no case of chikungunya was reported in France."

71,"Human influenza virus usually refers to those subtypes that spread widely among humans. There are only three known A subtypes of influenza viruses (H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2) currently circulating among humans. It is likely that some genetic parts of current human influenza A viruses came from birds originally. Influenza A viruses are constantly changing, and they might adapt over time to infect and spread among humans."
72,"During an outbreak of avian influenza among poultry, there is a possible risk to people who have contact with infected birds or surfaces that have been contaminated with secretions or excretions from infected birds."
73,"Between February and October 2006 alone, more than 1.25 million people in India and south Asia were infected with the chikungunya virus. Other large-scale outbreaks of chikungunya fever have occurred in countries of east and central Africa, and the Indian Ocean countries, including Comoros, Gabon, Madagascar, the Maldives, Mauritius, Mayotte, Reunion (France) and the Seychelles. In September 2007, a chikungunya outbreak has been notified in Italy."
